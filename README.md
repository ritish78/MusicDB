# MusicDB
This is a simple Java program which read a database file. The database file contains three tables, Songs, Albums and Artists. We are connecting the Java program to get all the data from the database and then printing Songs, Albums and Artists.

For testing purposes, you need to add Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to the project in your end.
